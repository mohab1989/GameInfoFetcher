            Just upload your game library, and youâ€™ll get back a CSV file with useful info for each game, like how long it will take to beat and its review score.
        
            Import this CSV file into Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets, organize and sort the info however you like, and make it easier to decide what to play next</p>
